\subsection{Constitution}
	\label{ssec:usa@constitution}
\paragraph{The Declaration of Independence}
In the Declaration of Independence the thirteen American colonies announced their freedom from
British rule. One July 11th 1776, Congress appointed a committee to draft a formal Declaration of
Independence. Thomas Jefferson, one of the appointed members, was asked to write the draft,
which he completed in about two weeks. The date of its adoption by the Second Continental
Congress on July 4th 1776, is celebrated as the birthday of the United States.
\begin{example}
When, in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to
dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to
assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which
the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the
opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel
them to the separation.\\
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they
are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are
Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights,
Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the
consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes
destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and
to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and
organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their
Safety and Happiness.
\end{example}

\paragraph{The Preamble to the United States Constitution}
The Preamble to the United States Constitution, beginning with the words \enquote{We the People}, is a brief
introductory statement of the Constitution's fundamental purposes and guiding principles. Courts
have referred to it as reliable evidence of the Founding Fathers' intentions regarding the
Constitution's meaning and what they hoped the Constitution would achieve.
\begin{example}
We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union,
establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence,
promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and
our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of
America.
\end{example}

\paragraph{The Bill of Rights}
The original Constitution of the USA was concerned with the way the new government would be
structured and what powers it had. People were worried that the government might become too
powerful and autocratic, just like the British king, so a Bill of Rights consisting of ten amendments
(i.e. changes) to the Constitution was quickly passed in 1791. These amendments were intended to
protect the people from their rulers. The Bill of Rights describes the basic rights of the people and
forbids the government from denying these liberties. Included are the freedoms of speech, religion,
the press, and the right to assemble. Today the Bill of Rights also serves to protect minorities and
individuals from the majority. Altogether there have been 27 amendments to the Constitution.
\begin{example}
\fakeparagraph{Amendment I}
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging
the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government
for a redress of grievances.

\fakeparagraph{Amendment II}
A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall
not be infringed.

\fakeparagraph{Amendment III}
No soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the consent of the owner, nor in time of war, but in a
manner to be prescribed by law.

\fakeparagraph{Amendment IV}
The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and
seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and
particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.
\end{example}
\subsection{Values}
	\label{ssec:usa@values}
\paragraph{Democracy}
Representative government and the separation of powers in a system of checks
and balances are the basis of American Democracy, which should represent American
citizen's interests and be an example to the world.

\paragraph{The Pursuit of Happiness}
The American Constitution sees it as an unalienable right for every citizen to seek
self-fulfilment. The Pursuit of Happiness, together with the right to life and liberty, are at the core of the
US American understanding of democracy.

\paragraph{Individual Freedom}
Americans' understanding of Individual Freedom is shaped by the Founding Fathers' belief that all
people are equal. Through the US Constitution's Bill of Rights, the government is
responsible for protecting each individual's basic \enquote{inalienable} rights among
which are freedom of speech, press, and religion.

\paragraph{Individualism and Self-Reliance}
Closely connected to the notion of freedom, the idea of Individualism and Self-Reliance encourages American
citizens to trust in themselves, their abilities, and their conscience to cope with
their individual fate.

\paragraph{Can-Do-Spirit}
Inventiveness and a tendency to idealize whatever works or is practical illustrate
an American's Can-Do-Spirit which is often attributed to the frontier experience where man
was left to his own devices when it came to survive in the wilderness.

\paragraph{Equal Opportunities}
Over centuries, the concept of the American Dream has taught Americans that
self-realization can be achieved through hard work, thrift, family loyalty, and faith
in free enterprise. Equal Opportunities, however, have not been within reach for all: segregation and
discrimination have interfered with indigenous peoples and minorities' attempts
to realize the rights and freedoms, which are also guaranteed for them by the
Constitution.

\paragraph{Mobility}
For the US nation of immigrants, in which moving elsewhere and making a fresh
start is seen as a practical solution to many a challenge, Mobility can be described as a
form of realized optimism promising a better life ahead.

\paragraph{Patriotism}
Slogans like Proud to be American, the playing of the national anthem at sporting
events or the pledging of allegiance, which starts off every school morning, are
signs of a heartfelt omnipresent Patriotism which show Americans' intensified sense of
national identity and pride in their nation's unique promises.

\paragraph{Progress}
Americans associate Progress with the idea of making use of the opportunities, which
their nation holds in store for them. Hard work and the willingness to make sacrifices
for a better tomorrow promise self-realization as well as an increase in
material plenty from generation to generation.

\paragraph{National Security}
In recent years National Security has come into focus. 9/11 left Americans in a state of shock
and has made certain rights negotiable (right to privacy) which were formerly
undisputed.
\subsection{Immigration}
	\label{ssec:usa@immig}
The English have been going to North America from the late 16th century on; Spain sent people to the
southern part of the region and many Dutch and Germans also went over.

When the U.S. became independent, it was written into the \emph{Constitution} that there could be no
limits on immigration until 1808. The main period of immigration was between 1800 and 1917. Early
in this period, many immigrants arrived from Britain and Germany, and many Chinese went to
California. Later, the main groups were Italians, Irish, Eastern Europeans and Scandinavians. Many
Jews came from Germany and Eastern Europe. Just before World War I, there were nearly a million
immigrants a year. Many immigrants came to New York and Boston, and Ellis Island, near New York,
became famous as a receiving station. The \emph{Immigration Act of 1917}, and other laws that followed it,
limited the number of immigrants and the countries that they could come from. Since then,
immigration has been limited to a few people who are selected for an immigrant visa, commonly
called green card. Hispanics and Asians now make up the largest group of immigrants.

Immigration policy, including illegal immigration to the United States, was a signature issue of former
U.S. president \emph{Donald Trump's} presidential campaign. He repeatedly said that illegal immigrants are
criminals. A hallmark promise of his campaign was to build a substantial wall on the United States-
Mexico border and to force Mexico to pay for the wall.

\subsection{Gun laws}
	\label{ssec:usa@guns}
\paragraph{Gun culture in the US}
According to reliable estimates there are about 393 million privately owned firearms in
the USA. Around 40\% of Americans live in a household with a gun, which means that
many gun-owners own more than one gun. The USA is the country with the highest gun
ownership rate in the world, followed by Yemen and Switzerland.

Guns have played a major role in American history, especially in the settlement of the
continent and in the various wars that have been fought by Americans. As a means of
self-protection and as a tool for hunting guns were vital to American settlers. In
American popular culture, guns have often been depicted in a positive light. Just think of
Western movies or the characters played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. At the same time
gun ownership has for a long time been a hotly debated topic, each school shooting
serving as a trigger of another round of discussions.

Supporters of gun ownership such as the National Rifle Association (NRA) point to the
2nd Amendment to the Constitution and consider every attempt of the government to
restrict gun ownership as an encroachment on their personal freedom. Claiming that
hundreds of people use guns each year for self-defense, they believe that privately
owned guns reduce crime rate rather than causing it. Opponents of gun ownership, on
the other hand, point to studies that show a decline in homicides and suicides by
firearms after the introduction of stricter gun laws. In addition they maintain that guns in
households can easily lead to accidents or an escalation that wouldn't have happened if
a gun hadn't been involved.
